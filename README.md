## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Aflah Tsuroyya and Iâ€™m a 2nd year student, majoring in Geophysics at Universitas Gadjah Mada. I have a lot of hobbies, such as painting, reading some books, listening to music, and so on. 
I love art, so much, and i always excited to go to the exhibition or museum. And the reason why i ended up in this major is because i'd like to learn about earth and everything inside. 

If you want to know more about me, you can contact me through email at aflahtsuroyyaassilmi@mail.ugm.ac.id or find me on instagram @tsuroyyaflah
